        An experienced software engineer with 5 years of experience, in frontend
        development (React & Angular), and a year in backend development (Node,
        Express & MongoDB). I write readable, reusable, scalable, declarative
        codes with strict compliance to best practices and understand every
        stage of project's cycle from design, development, testing (unit & end
        to end), and deployment to different environments. With my vast
        knowledge of CSS I can implement pixel-perfect UI designs with a great
        deal of responsiveness.

        object-oriented programming (OOP), async programming (promises and
        reactive approach using rxjs observables streams).

        <br />
